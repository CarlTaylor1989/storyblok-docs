title: Presets
---

As a developer, you can now define multiple default values for your components. For example, a teaser component can have three styles: 
- teaser with a background image 
- teaser with text only and solid background color 
- teaser with a call to action button.

To make it easier for the editor to find the necessary configuration of this three styles you can save it as presets and upload a screenshot.
